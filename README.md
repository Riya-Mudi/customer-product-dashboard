# Customer - product dashboard (SQL + Power BI)
Analyzed a Kaggle ecommerce dataset using SQL and Power BI to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and build a multi-page dashboard covering product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends.


## Project Overview
This project presents a multi-page Power BI dashboard built to analyze ecommerce customer behavior across 250,000+ transactions and 49k+ unique customers. Using SQL for data cleaning and aggregation, Excel for churn logic flagging, and DAX for dynamic calculations, the dashboard delivers insights across four key areas: overall KPIs, product performance by category, customer demographics segmented by age and gender, and time-based trends in churn, returns, and sales. The goal was to create a stakeholder-ready report that blends financial logic with technical tooling, enabling clear visibility into customer patterns and business performance. This project reflects a commerce-tech hybrid approach to analytics‚Äîleveraging structured data, lean reporting, and process optimization to drive actionable insights.
